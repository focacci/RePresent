# RePresent

## Mission Statement
RePresent's mission is to provide an intuitive interface through which
constituents can find primary source information on their elected officials
representing their financial and electoral incentives. 

RePresent will be designed to be as plainly objective as possible. We will only
 provide information from primary sources. There will NOT be any form of user
 input viewable by another user. Additionally, we will NOT provide any
 summarization, or any form of interpretation, except mathematical
 representations of statistical data. 

We will focus on providing data including (but not limited to):
- Funding (source, quantity, date, etc)
- Legislative bills (which they supported, cosponsored, wrote, voted on, etc)
- The governmental body which they represent (demographic data, changes to 
    district borders, etc)
- Locations of public appearances.
